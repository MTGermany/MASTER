Hello Sheng Peng,

please find attached a code fragment providing the core calcualtions
of the GKT model.

The function 
void calc_rhsGKT (...) calculates, for one time step, the right-hand
side fields of the GKT equations in the flow-conservative form 

              ________________________________________________
              |  d_t rho(x,t)  = -d_x F1 + S1 (ramp flows)    |
              |  d_t Q(x,t)    = -d_x F2 + S2                 |
              ------------------------------------------------

(see comments in the program)

The file calc_rhsGKT.cc contains also some helper functions, such as
a method to add ramp terms to the sources (add_rmpGKT), a fast
interpolation routine, intpGKT(..), and  the shifting routine
shift_in_xGKT(..) calculating the nonlocal terms of the GKT model.

Since I cannot give you the complete program (it is copyrighted) you
have to provide the framework by yourself such as 

* the model parameters
(in the program they are expected partly as x-dependent fields, e.g.,
v0_loc[i] denotes the local desired velocity at position i)

* the initialization

* the existence and location of ramps (for systems without ramps you
can drop the add_rmpGKT method)

* the kind of boundary conditions (choice_BC=0 means periodic boundary
conditions), and their implementation

* the update routine (for the GKT, chose the upwind method by setting
the parameter "downwind_diff"=false in the method calc_rhsGKT)

yours,

Martin Treiber
